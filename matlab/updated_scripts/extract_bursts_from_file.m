% Searches through the specified file for the first ZC sequence, and extracts the full bursts (in time)
%
% It's very important that the `frequency_offset` be correct such that when applied, the signal is centered at DC (0 Hz)
% Otherwise the start sample estimate from correlating for the ZC sequence will be off in time as well as the
% correlation score being lower
%
% @param input_path File containing complex 32-bit floating point samples (interleaved I,Q,I,Q,...)
% @param sample_rate Sample rate that the file was recorded at.  Must be an integer multiple of 15.36 MSPS (the minimum 
%                    sample rate for the DroneID downlink)
% @param frequency_offset How far off from DC the signal is in the recording (set to 0 for no frequency adjustment)
% @param correlation_threshold Score on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 where 1.0 is a perfect match with the ZC sequence.  This
%                              will determine how closely the recorded ZC sequence must match in order to be extracted
%                              as a burst.  Usually anywhere from 0.2 to 0.9 are usable values.
% @param chunk_size How many samples to process at one time.  This depends on how much RAM your system has.  This value
%                   should likely be set > 1e6 but < 20e6.  But you do you.
% @param padding How many additional samples before and after the burst to extract.  Must be >= 0
% @return bursts A matrix where each row contains one burst
